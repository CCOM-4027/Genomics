        <h3>Welcome to the Genomics Project</h3>

<p>
	This project focuses on database management in the field of genomics.
	The purpose of this project is to create a tool to properly analyze
	sequences' contigs. This database would allow us to look for, among other things,
	motifs, by doing a “contig  alignment”. It allows us to ask, for example,
	for all species in which two particular contigs occur within a certain distance
	from each other.
</p>

<h3>How it Works</h3>

<p>
	Briefly, a contig is a hypothetical sequence; a sequence of dna or rna is split into many small
	fragments and then assembled based on the likeliest pairings, in general short pairings are more
	likely than long pairings. A contig can represent anything from a coding region in dna
	(code that translates into a protein), regulatory regions (code that controls the expression of other code)
	or an entire gene. You may have many contigs inside a single one, or two given contigs may overlap.
	The job of genomicists is to accurately asses the composition and the function of each contig
	and how these relate to other contigs. Both, the composition and function of contigs follow general patterns
	called ‘motifs’, you might find similar contigs in a particular order. To determine the similarity between
	contigs we do what are called alignments, which matches two sequences such that their base pairs occur
	in the same order with the least number of gaps between them.	
</p>

<p>
	In order to store all of this information, we created a database that sorts all of this information
	into an efficient database, in which the user performs queries, and gets only the data that the user wants.
